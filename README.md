# **Mnemonic To Wallet**

## 📜 Project Description

This project is a **cryptographic wallet generator** that creates secure mnemonics, derives cryptographic keys, and generates Bitcoin addresses. It ensures compliance with standards such as **BIP-39** (mnemonics) and **BIP-32** (HD wallets).<br> All generated data, including mnemonics, private keys, chain codes, and addresses, are securely stored in a SQLite database.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Custom Mnemonic Length Generation**
  <br>_Generate mnemonics of various lengths (**12** and **24 words**)._

- 🔑 **Derive a secure seed from the mnemonic using a passphrase.**

- 🛠️ **Generate master private keys and chain codes based on BIP-32.**

- 🧠 **Generate Bitcoin legacy addresses.**

- 🗄️ **Save wallet information in a SQLite database**
  <br>_mnemonic, seed, private key, chain code, and address._

- ⚠️ **Avoid duplicate mnemonics and addresses in the database.**

- 📡 **Real-Time Display**

- 📖 **Extensive logging for transparency and debugging.**

- 📥 **Result Recording**
  <br>_Automatic saving of found mnemonic, private key and wallet addresses._

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- `Python 3.11`

- Required Python libraries (_see [Installation](#installation)_)
  - `binascii`
  - `ecdsa`
  - `hashlib`
  - `hmac`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `shadePy`
  - `tqdm`

## **Installation**

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system before running the install command.

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0x414854/Mnemonic_To_Wallet.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd Mnemonic_To_Wallet

   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file to define your environment variables

   ```env
   BIP39_FILE = 'path/to/utils/bip39_words.txt'
   ALL_LEGACY_BTC_DB_WALLET_FILE = 'path/to/utils/legacy_btc_wallets.db' # This file contains all current Bitcoin legacy addresses (as of 01/07/2025)
   WALLETS_DB_FILE = 'path/to/utils/wallets.db'
   LOG_FILE = 'path/to/BTC_finder.log'
   RESULT_FILE = 'path/to/result_file.txt'
   ```

4. Place your BIP-39 wordlist file (`bip39_words.txt`) in the specified path.
   _You can obtain the file from [here](https://github.com/0x414854/Words_BIP39/blob/main/wordsBIP39.txt)._

## ▶️ Usage

- Run the script to generate wallet

  ```bash
  python mnemonicToWallet.py
  ```

The program will :

- **Generate a unique mnemonic**
- **Derive the seed, master private key, and chain code**
- **Generate the associated Bitcoin Legacy address**
- **Save wallet information to the database and optionally a results file**

## 🔐 Security and Ethics

- **Educational Use Only**<br>_This script is developed solely for educational and research purposes. It is not intended for use in any real-world financial or production environment._
- **No Responsibility**<br>_The authors and contributors of this project disclaim all responsibility for any misuse or unintended consequences resulting from its use. Users are fully responsible for any actions performed using this script._
- **Do Not Use for Real Funds**<br>_The wallets generated by this program are not secure and must never be used to store or manage actual cryptocurrency assets. Always rely on trusted and secure wallet solutions for real funds._
- **Sensitive Data Handling**<br>_This program interacts with highly sensitive information, such as private keys and mnemonics. Users must take strict measures to ensure that such data is handled securely and is not exposed to unauthorized parties._
- **Ethical Use**<br>_By using this script, you agree to act ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes avoiding unauthorized access to any systems or wallets that do not belong to you._

By proceeding with this project, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure its proper use, and that you accept all risks associated with handling sensitive cryptographic information.

### Notes

- Times are measured in seconds (`s`) and correspond to the total time taken for each number of iterations.
- The benchmarks were conducted using the `benchmarks.py` script with the `timeit` module.
- These results may vary depending on the performance of the machine used.

### Instructions to Update Benchmarks

- Run the benchmark script

  ```bash
  python3 tests/benchmarks.py
  ```
